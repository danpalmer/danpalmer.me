title: Reddit Workflow for Alfred 2
---

The [Alfred 2.0 beta](http://blog.alfredapp.com/2013/01/12/first-alfred-v2-beta-now-available-for-mega-supporters/) was released earlier tonight and as an avid user, I wanted to start writing workflows immediately.

Workflows are able to take input from the user in many different ways: actions on files, keyworks, shortcuts, etc, and then return data as notifications, search results and actions such as opening a browser.

After seeing David Ferguson's brilliant [Google Auto-Complete workflow](http://jdfwarrior.tumblr.com/post/40354870777/a-few-alfred-2-workflows-to-get-you-started) I realised the power of workflows and set about making one that helped me use one of my favourite websites, [Reddit](http://reddit.com/).

Luckily reading data from Reddit is as simple as adding `.json` or `.xml` to the end of a url, so here's what I've managed so far.

Typing `r/` will list the top 'hot' items on Reddit, and `r/subreddit` will give you the top items from a specific subreddit.

_Update:_ The workflow has now been fixed to work with the release version of Alfred 2. Links should work again now.
