I've been using the [Moonlander](moonlander) from [ZSA](zsa) for nearly 2 years now, but with the prospect of returning to an office I needed another keyboard to keep at work so decided to order the [Ultimate Hacking](uhk) from Ultimate Gadget Labs.

This post is a comparative review of the two, focusing on the things that matter to me as a software engineer and someone using a keyboard for a lot of typing every day. While the mechanical keyboard community are a great source of information about products, they often have a hobbyist focus that doesn't quite fit with my use-case. This review will therefore have a slightly different focus.

Let's get into it...

### Feature set

Both keyboards come with a lot of features and functionality, including:

- Split keyboard design
- Tilting/tenting for better ergonomics
- Highly configurable keymaps with features like mouse emulation
- Hot-swappable keys, high quality key switches
- Configurable per-key lighting
- USB-C interface and cable, with included USB-A adapter

The Moonlander comes with a carrying case and adjustment tool.

The UHK does not come with anything additional, but has a range of accessories and spare parts available for purchase. I got the palm rests, key cluster module, and trackball module. I also configured the UHK with the ISO layout and the blank keycaps.

Both include the same white-labelled tool that every other keyboard, keycap set, and keyswitch set has come with for years. It's nice that it's included for anyone who is purchasing their first mechanical keyboard, but I can't help but feel it's unnecessary for many, and fails to live up to the quality of the rest of the product.

I opted for Kailh Gold speed switches on the Moonlander – tactile, high actuation point, low actuation force. On the UHK I have Kailh silent box brown switches – tactile, low-noise, low actuation force.

### Build quality

For the most part the build quality is very good, but falls short of companies with the best build quality. If you're used to plastic construction computer accessories you'll be very satisfied with the overall quality, but if you're used to Apple products with metal construction you may be slightly disappointed, although I don't feel like that difference is particularly consequential.

The body of the UHK feels marginally higher quality than the body of the Moonlander. This may be due to the metal base plate used in the UHK, although it's possible the Moonlander has a metal base plate hidden inside. On a desk, the UHK feels very stable, whereas the Moonlander can feel slightly unstable depending on how it's tented. I was however slightly disapponted with the connection between the halves of the UHK, which doesn't have quite the magnetic snap that I was hoping for. I doubt this will matter though as I intend to use it split all the time with modules.

As for UHK accessories, the palm rests are wonderful, solid hardwood on a strong metal plate, and by far the highest quality piece of the setup. The modules feel slightly less solid than the rest of the setup, and in particular the trackballs on the trackball module and the keycluster module feel loose, to the point where they can jump around affecting the tracking slightly. The trackball module comes with a few options, including a metal ball weighing around 7g compared to the ~1.5g plastic balls – using this significantly improves the trackball module's usability.

The last thing I noticed about the UHK's build quality was USB-C socket that sits underneath the body. As someone who will likely move my keyboard on a regular basis this feels awkward, and I can't help but think that a USB-C socket mounted on the outside of the keyboard would have been better. I've solved this by purchasing a magnetic, magsafe-style USB-C cable.

On to the Moonlander, the lack of accessories means there isn't a lot to talk about, but there are a few things I felt could have been better. The palm rests feel unstable and rattle a little on all the Moonlanders that I have seen. The cable that connects the two halves is a plastic TRRS cable that's very long. While it's great that the cable is long, I suspect that most people use the halves within 20cm of each other, so a coiled cable would have been a nice touch. I've looked into replacement cables, but options are limited for TRRS. Braided cables are also an easy way to make a product feel more premium, and for the price point of the Moonlander I think it's something they should consider.

The last thing to mention is the Moonlander's "carrying case". While on paper this sounds helpful, the reality is less so. It provides little protection to the keyboard, and requires fully de-tenting the keyboard to use making it impractical for frequent use. It's better than nothing, but probably no better than purchasing an Amazon Basics laptop sleeve, and is of similar quality.

As mentioned, both keyboards have a good build quality and I think most people would be happy with either, but neither is without faults. For the base models, the UHK is slightly better, but accounting for the palm rests the UHK has a clearly superior build quality.

### Hardware layout

One of the biggest differences between the keyboards is the fact that the Moonlander is an _ortholinear_ layout, while the UHK is a more traditional staggered layout.

The Moonlander's layout took a bit of getting used to, but having done so I now have a minor preference for ortholinear layouts. I find the thumb clusters to be well positioned when in a tented configuration, although I have heard from people who find the keys hard to reach. I suspect the bigger hands you have the better. Something that's great about the Moonlander is the _number_ of keys that it has. There are plenty for binding to shortcuts and macros, without even needing to introduce more configuration layers.

### Configuration options

### Default configurations

### Firmware flashing

When I started planning this post, shortly before my UHK arrived, I even consider writing this section. Flashing new configuration for the Moonlander is a straightforward process: you download the new firmware from the configuration tool, open the flashing tool than needs to be installed locally, drag and drop the firmware, click "flash", press the reset button on the keyboard with a paperclip, wait about 5 seconds, and it's done.

I don't mean to imply sarcasm with this description, it's a process that mirrors many others for different hardware, and was exactly what I expected for both the Moonlander and the UHK.

This is not how flashing works with the UHK. After changing configuration you simply click the "Save to Keyboard" button, wait about a second, and it's done. It's magical. I don't mean that it's magic – the fact that the configuration software is a local application rather than a web application means that there's no need for a separate flashing tool. The process however _feels_ magical, and completely transforms the configuration experience.

The deeper I get with configuration, into things like the pointer acceleration for mouse keys, the more I find that I can't know whether configuration is right or useful without trying it and seeing how it feels. With the Moonlander's many step process for flashing a new configuration, the feedback loop is long, making changes harder. With the UHK, re-flashing is so low friction that the feedback loop is practically instant. For anyone planning to change their configuration on a regular basis this is an advantage to the UHK that is hard to overstate.
