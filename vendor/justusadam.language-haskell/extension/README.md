# Haskell Language support

Support for the Haskell programming language in visual studio code.

## Highlighting

Adds highlighting support for Haskell (.hs and .lhs).
This is a (now heavily) modified version of the syntax file from the [Haskell TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/haskell.tmbundle).
Additionally there is support for Cabal files (.cabal) via a concoction of my own. 

Also adds automatic indentation after `where`, `do`, `->` etc. and surrounding brackets (`[]`, `{}` etc)
