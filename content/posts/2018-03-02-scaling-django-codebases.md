Four of us from the Thread engineering team went to PyCon UK again in
September for the third year running, and I was lucky enough to have my talk
selected.

At Thread we use Django for the backend of the main site which has grown to over
350 [“apps”][1], and various members of the team have used the framework since
not long after the initial public release.

I’ve learnt many tips, tricks, and best practices for keeping engineers
productive on a codebase of this size from my colleagues over the years, and I
shared the highlights with the Python community in September.
